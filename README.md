- 👋 Hi, I’m @PauliMendoza
- 🌍 With 6 years of professional experience in logistics and supply chain, I recently embarked on a thrilling journey to Europe to embrace language learning, cultural exploration, and coding!
- 📚 Currently, I'm delving into the intricacies of the French language, adding another linguistic feather to my cap after mastering English during my time here. Additionally, I've been immersing myself in coding, eagerly picking up programming languages to expand my skill set and enhance my problem-solving abilities...
- 💻 My journey into coding kicked off out of sheer curiosity, much like my dive into the logistics world. I've noticed intriguing parallels between the systematic approach of supply chain management and the logical thinking required in coding. It's fascinating to witness how these two realms intersect and complement each other. When I'm not guiding tourists or delving into history, I often explore the past and ponder how ancient civilizations like the Romans mastered the art of efficient supply chains, crucial for their far-reaching conquests and trade networks.
-🧗‍♂️ When I'm not digging into history or showing folks around the charming streets of Europe, you'll probably catch me hanging off rock walls, totally into sport climbing, or just out for a run, feeling that awesome runner's high
- 💬 If you're looking to collaborate on projects that blend adventure, language, history, sustainability, and coding, or simply want to share stories about scaling heights or exploring the nooks and crannies of European cities, feel free to reach out! Let's connect and embark on an exciting journey together, both in the physical world and the digital realm of coding!
